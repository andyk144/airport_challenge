My code isn't complete. I struggled to link in the weather to the airport. I followed the youtube video that Sam Morgan has made to do this and once I had finished all of the rspec tests I realised that it didn't actually work in irb.

I tried to correct this but this ended up messing up my rspec tests more and more so I reverted the head back to my last commit.

I had implemented methods on the planes to show if they were flying or landed however, this was done after my last commit and was lost when I reset the head.
