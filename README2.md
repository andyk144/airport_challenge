My code isn't complete. I had some issues with linking the weather class to the airport. I followed the youtube video that Sam Morgan has made to do this and originally had problems with irb requiring arguments, which I've now managed to resolve.

When I tried to correct the original problems I had, I ended up messing up my rspec tests more and more so I reverted the head back to my last commit.

I had implemented methods on the planes to show if they were flying or landed however, this was done after my last commit and was lost when I reset the head.

I need to add back in the methods for the plane, which we lost and the respective rspec tests to go with them. I also didn't get a chance to go through and do all of the refactoring I would have liked due to the time taken to resolve the above problem.
